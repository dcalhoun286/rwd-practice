## Overview

- In [Lab 01](https:/dcalhoun286.github.io), you built a web page where each box of content was rendered with a unique color in desktop view and in mobile view.
- You will be completing this assignment again, using either Flexbox or CSS grids for styling.

## Feature: Responsive Design

- **Why are we implementing this feature?**
  - As a user, I want the dimensions and colors of the application to change so that I can have a unique view in desktop, mobile, and tablet viewports.

- **What are we going to implement?**
- Given that a user opens the application in the browser, on a tablet, or on a mobile device, when the user changes the size of the viewport, the boxes should scale proportionally and change colors.

- **How are we implementing it?**
  - Use Flexbox or CSS grids for styling this application.
  - Use relative units so the elements scale proportionally when the viewport dimensions change.
  - Use at least two breakpoints and change the background colors of each box. There should be three possible views: desktop, tablet, and mobile device. You may choose the exact pixel values for each breakpoint.
